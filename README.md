# perfect_calculator
This is a joke Python program, a calculator that doesn't use * or **, just + and - (no division :D)

# How to use
Just copy paste the code in a file and run it with Python

### What's special about this one?
This calculator only uses built-in + and -
multiplication and exponentiation are made manually
division is not available.

### License Summary
Do whatever you want with it! no real limitations.

### Example Output
```
Welcome to my calculator!

Enter first number: 9
What operation to preform (+ - x ^): -
Enter second number: 3
What do you think the result is: 5
False! 9 - 3 = 6
```
